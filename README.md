# Linux & Zsh Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning process in the Linux terminal, specifically using **Zsh** on macOS. As a Data Professional, mastering the CLI (Command Line Interface) is essential for productivity and automation.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to separate concepts from practical tools:

- **/notes**: detailed explanations of core concepts, cheat sheets, and challenges.
  - `notes.md`: The main guide covering commands, permissions, and productivity tips.
  - `flags.md`: Deep dive into specific command flags.
  - `linux_cheatsheet.html`: Quick reference guide.
  - `CHALLENGE_1.md`: Real-world scenarios to test knowledge (Navigation).
  - `CHALLENGE_2.md`: Permissions & Safety scenarios.
  - `CHALLENGE_3.md`: Data filtering with grep and pipes.
- **/scripts**: Automation scripts.
  - `push_studies.sh`: A script to automate git add/commit/push for this repo.

## Main Commands Learned
- **Navigation:** `pwd`, `ls -lah`, `cd`
- **File Management:** `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`
- **System Monitoring:** `top`, `df -h`
- **Search & Pipe:** `grep`, `|`, `wc`

## Goals
- [x] Master basic Zsh navigation and shortcuts.
- [ ] Automate daily data tasks with Shell Scripts.
- [ ] Deep dive into "Pipes" and "Redirections".
- [ ] Explore advanced uses of `sed` and `awk` for data processing.
